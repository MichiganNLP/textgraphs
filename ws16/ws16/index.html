<h3> TextGraphs -- the 10th edition </h3>
<br>
<p>For the past 10 years, the series of TextGraphs workshops have exposed and encouraged the synergy between the field of Graph Theory (GT) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The mix between the two started small, with graph theoretical framework providing efficient and elegant solutions for NLP applications. Solutions focused on single documents for part-of-speech tagging, word sense disambiguation, and semantic role labelling, and got progressively larger with ontology learning and information extraction from large text collections. Nowadays, the solutions have reached web scale through new fields of research that focus on information propagation in social networks, rumor proliferation, e-reputation, multiple entity detection, language dynamics learning, and future events prediction to name a few.</p><br>


<p>The tenth edition of the TextGraphs workshop would be a new episode in the sequel, focused on issues and solutions for large-scale graphs, such as those derived for web-scale knowledge acquisition or social networks. We aim to encourage the description of novel NLP problems or applications that have emerged in recent years, which can be addressed with graph-based solutions, as well as novel graph-based methods. In this edition, we add a new focus area on the usage of graph-Â­based methods and NLP techniques to connect to resources and applications in the Semantic Web. Furthermore, we would also encourage research about graph-based methods in the field of Semantic Web to be connected to NLP related problems and applications. Bringing together researchers interested in Graph Theory applied to Natural Language Processing and Semantic Web will provide an environment for further integration of graph-based solutions into different research fields. This will lead to a deeper understanding of new theories of graph-based algorithms, create new approaches, and widen the usage of graphs.
The target audience is comprised of researchers working on problems related to either Graph Theory or graph-based algorithms applied to Natural Language Processing, social media, and the Semantic Web. </p><br>
