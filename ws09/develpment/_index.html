					<p>Recent years have shown an increased amount of  interest in applying graph theoretic models to computational  linguistics. Both graph theory and computational linguistics are well  studied disciplines which have traditionally been perceived as  distinct, embracing different algorithms, different applications, and  different potential end-users. However, as recent research work has  shown, the two seemingly distinct disciplines are in fact intimately  connected, with a large variety of natural language processing  applications adopting efficient and elegant solutions from  graph-theoretical framework. </p>
					
					<p> Traditional graph theory, which is studied as a  sub-discipline of mathematics, has been successfully applied in  modeling and solving several applications in Natural Language  Processing. More recently, complex network theory, a popular modeling  paradigm in statistical mechanics and physics of complex systems, was  proven to be a promising tool in understanding the structure and  dynamics of languages. Complex network based models have been applied  to areas as diverse as language evolution, acquisition, historical  linguistics, mining and analyzing the social networks of blogs and  emails, link analysis and information retrieval, information  extraction, and representation of the mental lexicon. </p>
					<p> Similarly, in many NLP applications entities can  be naturally represented as nodes in a graph and relations between them  can be represented as edges. Recent research has shown that graph-based  representations of linguistic units as diverse as words, sentences and  documents give rise to novel and efficient solutions in a variety of  NLP tasks, ranging from part of speech tagging, word sense  disambiguation and parsing to information extraction, semantic role  assignment, summarization, and sentiment analysis. </p>
					<p> The TextGraphs workshop addresses a broad spectrum  of research areas and brings together specialists working on  graph-based models and algorithms for natural language processing and  computational linguistics, as well as on the theoretical foundations of  related graph-based methods. This workshop is aimed at fostering an  exchange of ideas by facilitating a discussion about both the  techniques and the theoretical justification of the empirical results  among the NLP community members. Spawning a deeper understanding of the  basic theoretical principles involved, such interaction is vital to the  further progress of graph-based NLP applications. </p>
					<p> The workshop have a special theme on  “Cognitive and Social Dynamics of Languages in the framework of Complex  Networks.” Cognitive dynamics of languages include topics focused  primarily on language acquisition, which can be extended to language  change (historical linguistics) and language evolution as well. Since  the latter phenomena are also governed by social factors, we can  further classify them under social dynamics of languages. In addition,  social dynamics of languages also include topics such as mining the  social networks of blogs and emails.  </p>
					<p>Apart from the special theme, TextGraphs-4 also invite submissions on the following (but not limited to) general  topics: </p>
					<ul type="disc">
                      <li>Graph-based       representations, acquisition and evaluation of lexicon and ontology </li>
					  <li>Node and       edge labeling for linguistic graphs </li>
					  <li>Properties       of lexical, semantic, syntactic and phonological graphs </li>
					  <li>Graph  methods for morpho-syntactic annotation, word sense disambiguation,  information retrieval, information extraction, summarization, text  mining and understanding </li>
					  <li>Random       walk models in NLP </li>
					  <li>Graph       clustering algorithms </li>
					  <li>Application       of spectral graph theory in NLP </li>
					  <li>Unsupervised       and semi-supervised graph-based methods </li>
					  <li>Dynamic       graph representations for NLP </li>
					  <li>Comparative       analysis of graph-based methods and traditional machine leaning techniques       for NLP applications. </li>
				  </ul>
