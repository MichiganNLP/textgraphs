				TextGraphs is in its seventh edition! This shows that the disciplines graph theoretic models and computational linguistics, are naturally connected, with a large variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications adopting efficient and elegant solutions from graph-theoretical framework.

			<h3>About TextGraphs</h3>
The TextGraphs workshops series brings together researchers interested in Graph Theory applied to Natural Language Processing and provides an environment for further integration of graph-based solutions into NLP tasks. The workshops encourage discussions about theoretical justifications from GT that explain empirical results obtained in the NLP community. As a consequence, a deeper understanding of new theories of graph-based algorithms is likely to help to create new approaches and widen the usage of graphs for NLP applications.


			<h3>Special Theme: "Understanding and Mining Social Media Using Graphs: Information Propagation in Blogs and Tweets"
			</h3>
			Recent work in machine learning has provided interesting approaches to globally represent and process structures, e.g.:

The emergence of new fields of research focusing on the social media such as Twitter and Facebook brought the graph-based methods even more into focus. In particular, graph-based algorithms are used to explore social network connections and propagation of information in those networks in addition to exploring the connections between the language entities. As a consequence, many new applications have been emerging such as rumor proliferation, e-reputation, multiple identity detection, language dynamics learning and future events prediction  to name but a few.

			<h3>Invited Speaker</h3>

			We are delighted to announce that our invited speaker for TextGraph-7 will be <a href="www.ladamic.com">Lada Adamic</a> and she will give a talk on the information propagation in blogs and tweets.

			<ul>
				<li> regular full papers of max. 8 pages (one additional page for the Reference section only is allowed - for a maximum of 9 pages)</li>
				<li> regular short papers of max. 4 pages (one additional page for the Reference section only is allowed - for a maximum of 5 pages)</li>

			<h3>Author Instructions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li> Multiple-submission policy<br>
					
						Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must indicate this at submission time. 
						Authors submitting multiple papers to TextGraphs-7 may not submit papers that overlap significantly (50%) with each other in content or results. 		
						Authors of papers accepted for presentation at Textgraphs-7 must notify the organizers immediately as to whether the paper will be presented. 
						All accepted papers must be presented at the conference in order to appear in the proceedings.
					
				</li>
				<li> Blind review policy<br>
					
						In order to facilitate blind reviewing, the authors should omit their names and affiliations from the paper. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991)" must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991)". Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.
					</li>
				<li>Submission<br>
					
						 Papers should be submitted to the START Conference Manager at <a href="#">TBA</a>.
					
				</li>
			</ul>
