     <p style="text-align: justify;">
The Textgraphs workshops address a broad spectrum of research areas and brings together researchers working on problems related to the use of graph-based algorithms for natural language processing as well as on the theory of graph-based methods. Different NLP applications use different graph-based approaches, and bringing together researchers from different fields fosters the exchange of ideas. It aims to serve as a platform to enable deeper understanding of aspects of language amenable to graph-based approaches, and identification of principles of using graph theory for language that go beyond specific applications.
